Hands-on practice for the GH Flow Workshops

## Background

Practicing GH Flow is important. This repo has a toy practice problem to put the skills to use. 

Here's the problem

# GH Flow Hands-On

One team member creates a repo (be sure to start with a Readme) and adds the second team member to the repo. 

Add the following two issues:

Issue #1: “Add Team Member 1 to the Readme”
In order to practice branching, making and closing out a pull request, issues, and commits, please edit the Readme file in this repository. First. create a branch named “Add [your name] to Readme”. Put your name in the second line of the readme. Commit to this new branch. In your commit, mention, “Closes #1”. 

Issue #2 Add Team Member 2 to the Readme
In order to practice branching, making and closing out a pull request, issues, and commits, please edit the Readme file in this repository. First. create a branch named “Add [your name] to Readme”. Put your name in the second line of the readme. Commit to this new branch. In your commit, mention, “Closes #2”. 

Team Member 1 takes Issue #2, and Team Member 2 takes Issue #1

Team Member 1 takes Issue #1, and Team Member 2 takes Issue #2

Each person works on their issue on their individual branches, making a commit

Look at the Issues. Is Issue #1 closed yet? Why not?

Look at the Issues. Is Issue #2 closed yet? Why not?

Both team members create a Pull Request. Team Member 1 shares screen, reviews Team Member 2’s PR, merges, deletes branch, and closes the PR. 

Pull up the Issues. Is Issue #2 closed now? Why now, and not before?

Team Member 2 shares screen, reviews Team Member 1’s PR, and UH OH! Conflict!! Team Member 2 fixes it on GitHub using the editor. Merge, delete branch, and close the PR.

What would be the effect of keeping the branches alive longer, and making more and more changes before merging in?
